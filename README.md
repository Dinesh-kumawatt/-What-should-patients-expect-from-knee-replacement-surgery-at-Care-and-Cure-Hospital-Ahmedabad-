Knee replacement surgery is recommended for patients with severe knee pain, stiffness, or limited mobility due to arthritis or injury. Care and Cure Hospital Ahmedabad provides advanced total and partial knee replacement surgeries using minimally invasive techniques. Before surgery, patients undergo thorough evaluation, including X-rays and blood work, to determine suitability. During the procedure, damaged cartilage and bone are removed and replaced with artificial implants, restoring function and reducing pain. Post-operative care includes physiotherapy, pain management, and regular follow-up for best results. Most patients can walk within a few days and resume normal activities in 6â€“12 weeks. The hospital uses the latest implant technology and surgical navigation systems to ensure precision and faster recovery. Their orthopedic team provides detailed pre-op counseling and post-op rehabilitation to ensure a smooth recovery. For a full overview of the process and benefits, visit:
